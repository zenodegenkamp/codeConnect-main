# CodeConnect App
I conceptualized and developed this project as an integral component of the 'Advanced React' module within the Front-End Developer Career Path offered by Scrimba. The application is built on the React framework, with Firebase handling authentication, CSS Tailwind ensuring a polished visual aesthetic, and Spline enhancing the user experience with interactive 3D objects. The CodeConnect React app serves as a dynamic platform tailored for budding developers seeking real-world projects, as opposed to fictitious ones, to apply and hone their skills. Users are provided with a streamlined experience, enabling them to log in and efficiently manage all their projects. Upon logging in, users gain access to various sections, including 'Manage,' which mandates user authentication. To access the app's features, users can utilize the following login credentials: Username: zeno@test.nl and Password: zeno123. Once authenticated, users can navigate through the dashboard, review their income, oversee ongoing projects, and explore feedback and reviews.
